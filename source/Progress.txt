    TO DO

    FIX : Locate bug in moster ai that causes some monsters not to attack on activation

    ADD : Monster bored function - allow monster to grow weary of impossible
          to reach (attack) enemy and seek new enemy.
    ADD : Monster friend team support

    ADD : Monster team regroup code

    ADD : New player sub entity, charged with modifying gamma / fov for client

    Use to implement new special FX

        Glare from 'bright' objects at close range
        Lighting fx on medieval style worlds

    ADD : World soundfx module - use for spot fx etc..

  ADDED : look for new enemy function for monsters which have killed their
          current enemies and cannot see their previous (old) enemies

          A bug exists somewhere that caused an ogre to launch a totally
          unprovoked attack on a zombie

          The feature causes too much chaos in random games. Might have to
          see about a special team assignment algorithm for random games
          - ie small diffusion + monsters are put into teams sequentially by
          looking for a same class monster within a given radius.
          The algorithm would need to be called once all of the monsters
          have been spawned (tricky)

          This, with some refinements may prove to be an ideal distribution
          technique, keeping teams localised terratorially...


  ADDED : Monster seek new enemy function for monsters activated by distress
          calls - at least stop monster from just stopping dead
          Perhaps implement a 'memory' such that monster can return to his
          previous place

    FIXED : Located bug in monster activation that lead to occasional invulnerable enemy.

    ADDED : Allow monster to switch enemies of a team member calls and
current enemy is not visible

    ADDED : Allow enemy teams to respond to help calls with intention
of killing caller

    FIXED : minor bug in enemy detection code that forced team_ogre_3 never
to attack team_undead_1
